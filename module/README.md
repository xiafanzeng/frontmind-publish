# FrontMind Publish module

This directory is the reviewed source projection for the `publish` module. It is not yet a public GitHub repository or a deployed standalone service. The active production/application baseline is `332d5ef072104283601682a3aca165a127c14e2c`.

## Current projection

Files under this module's `contracts/`, `server/`, `schema/`, `client/`, `worker/`, and `workflows/` directories are the source currently approved for this projection. Authentication, private Core assembly, provider credentials, deployment configuration, customer data, and files still owned by Dashboard remain outside this directory.

## Standalone behavior

A standalone shell and manual-input flow are required before publication. Main-workbench imports are optional and must preserve source ID, version, and input snapshot. Do not infer that a missing file means deletion when preparing a Pro handoff ZIP.

See `PRO_GUIDE.md` for the current handoff boundary and incomplete areas.
